# Go-For-Devs  
This repository is for programmers already familiar with Java, Python, C or C++ or any other statically or dynamically typed language(except JS ofc ðŸ˜œ, Just Joking...)  
This tutorial will start with a very fast introduction to Go's basic syntax and datatypes.  
I have heavily borrowed from the roadmap avaialable [here](https://roadmap.sh/golang).  

## Prerequisites  
  1. Proficient with a statically typed or dyanmically typed language
  2. Have some exprience with asynchronous programming/multithreading in language of your choice.
  3. Having written a Web Server or worked with Web APIs in some form.
